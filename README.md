# SalesPPT

This project auto-generates sales presentations (PPTs) from transcripts provided by software team members within a company.

Instead of requiring the sales team to attend full meetings, contributors can simply record their voice responses to a predefined set of questions. Those recordings are transcribed, and the transcript content is then used to generate the sales PPT automatically.

## Purpose

- Reduce time spent by sales teams in internal meetings
- Capture product and technical updates directly from subject-matter experts
- Turn structured spoken input into consistent, presentation-ready sales decks

## High-Level Flow

1. Team members record answers to a standard question set.
2. Audio is transcribed into text.
3. The project processes transcripts and extracts relevant sales insights.
4. A sales PPT is generated automatically from the extracted content.
